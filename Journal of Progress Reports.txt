						Progress Report 1

Winning starts with beginning. – Robert H. Schuller

 
Create a webpage and supporting database for the Combat Veteran’s Motorcycle Association (CVMA). The database will be 
utilized to track membership data and potentially an online store.

At this point this is a solo project so I will be assuming all roles including requirements gathering, database design 
and implementation, web page design, and web security.

I had an initial meeting with the CVMA Secretary, Jeff Sines, who is excited about this project. He has invited me to 
speak at their next monthly meeting on 14 September to discuss with the rest of the membership.

						MID-TERM REPORT

Project Purpose:

To provide a website and supporting database to the Combat Veteran's Motorcycle Association (CVMA).  A non-profit
organization which assists U.S. Military Veterans in need, raises funds in support of other veteran based
charities, provides funeral escort services for fallen veterans, and ride motorcycles as a hobby.

The chapter of the CVMA which I am doing this project for does not currently have a website.  Instead, they have 
been utilizing a group on Facebook.  The website will provide a conduit to share with the public what the 
association does, as well as information pertaining to sponsored events and details for joining the association
for those eligible and interested.

They desire to have a membership discussion forum in which they can coordinate events, fund-raisers, and 
recreational motorcycle rides.

Additionally the leadership would like the database to track membership data as well as attendance record-keeping 
for meetings and events.
